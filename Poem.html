When we went away, </br>

When we got back, </br>

And when we stayed.</br>

It never really struck me--</br>

The things they say are worth living for, </br>

Because to me,</br>

There's no one else I'd rather live my life for, </br>

Than the girl who gave me everything to die for.

              Dear Princess, </br>

I have always adored you, </br>

From the moment we locked eyes, </br>

To the time we held hands, </br>

From the time I saw your smile, </br>

To the moment I felt your touch. </br>

I love you, more than words can ever say. </br> 

You saved me from my misery, </br>

You gave my life more color, </br>

All the things I've done, </br>

All the things I know, </br>

All of the things I have,</br>

I dedicate them all to you. </br>

You are amazing.

              Hello! Who would ever thought I would have the chance to do something like this again? </br>

We parted our ways, but we found our way back to each other. </br>

I'm still thankful, for the decision you made. </br>

I vow to always make you the happiest girl in the world, no matter what. </br>

You're still my girl, and you'll forever be my girl. </br>

Mahal na mahal kita. </br>

Hindi ko siguro alam kung nasaan ako ngayon kung wala ka. </br>

Salamat at nariyan ka. </br>

Salamat at mahal mo ako. </br>

Mga pagkakataong kasama kita; </br>

Mga kulitan, tawanan, tinginan, </br>

Lahat sila ang nagbibigay ng buhay sakin. </br>

Hindi ako mapapagod. </br>

They say the bright rays of the sun makes for a golden hour, </br>

But every moment spent with you, is my golden hour. </br>

Every moment laughing with you, is every rain and storm pushed away.</br>

A life without you, wouldn't be something I'd be happy to live.

            <p>
             I know everything, and I appreciate all of them. </br>

The things you do, the things you think of, </br>

The things you want, the things you wish to be, </br>

I see them all, in your eyes and in your mind. </br>

Continue to grow, love, and be the person you've always wished to be.</br> 

I'll always be here, and I will always be proud of you. </br>

This is a letter of appreciation especially for you. </br>

Thank you so much for everything. </br>

I wouldn't be here without you. </br>

That's why I always want to be there for you, because I know you need someone besides you. </br>

I won't get tired of listening to you. </br>

I won't get tired of telling you you're beautiful. </br>

I won't get tired of holding your hand. </br>

I won't get tired of you. </br>

My heart is full of love and appreciation to none other than you. </br>

If I could only take it out and give it to you, you'll understand how much I really mean the things I say. </br>

You'll understand what my words really mean.</br>

You'll understand how much I really love you. </br>

If only I can give you everything, I wouldn't mind having nothing. </br>

You're the best person in the world, and no one can tell me otherwise. </br>

You make me happy. </br>

You make me strong. </br>

You make me---ME.

I love you so much, Princess Nicole, I offer you my heart.
